========== Question ==========  

### What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?  

========== Answer ==========  

The `react` package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`,
`React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes.
You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to
build components. The `react-dom` package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in
`react-dom/server` we have _server-side rendering_ support with
`ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

========== Question ==========  

### What are the recommended ways for static type checking?  

========== Answer ==========  

Normally we use _PropTypes library_ (`React.PropTypes` moved to a `prop-types` package since React v15.5) for _type checking_ in the React applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use _static type checkers_ such as Flow or TypeScript, that perform type checking at compile time and provide auto-completion features.

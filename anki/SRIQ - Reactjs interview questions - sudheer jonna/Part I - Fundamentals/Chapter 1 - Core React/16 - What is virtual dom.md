========== Question ==========  

### What is Virtual DOM?  

========== Answer ==========  

The _Virtual DOM_ (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of _Real DOM_. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called _reconciliation_.

========== Question ==========  

### What are stateless components?  

========== Answer ==========  

If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a
stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating
stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your
components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits
if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write,
understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the `this` keyword
altogether.

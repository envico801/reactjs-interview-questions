### What are Pure Components?  

========== Answer ==========  

Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same
state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components
through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API
prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props
using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state
because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default
when you set the same state again.

The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,

```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);
```

Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents
re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).

```jsx
import { memo, useState } from 'react';
const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {
    return (
        <>
            <p>Name:{name}</p>
            <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </>
    );
});
export default function EmployeeRegForm() {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
    return (
        <>
            <label>
                Name:{' '}
                <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
            </label>
            <label>
                Email:{' '}
                <input
                    value={email}
                    onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
                />
            </label>
            <hr />
            <EmployeeProfile name={name} />
        </>
    );
}
```

In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So
there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.

In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of
_`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes,
_PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking
`shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

**Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.

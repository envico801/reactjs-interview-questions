========== Question ==========  

### What are the popular React-specific linters?  

========== Answer ==========  

ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse
specific code styles. One of the most common for React is an npm package called
`eslint-plugin-react`. By default, it will check a number of best practices,
with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop
types.

Another popular plugin is `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, which will help fix common
issues with accessibility. As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular
HTML, issues with `alt` text and `tabindex`, for example, will not be picked up
by regular plugins.

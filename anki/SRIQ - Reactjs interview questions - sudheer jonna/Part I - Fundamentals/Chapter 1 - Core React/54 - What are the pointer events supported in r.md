========== Question ==========  

### What are the Pointer Events supported in React?  

========== Answer ==========  

_Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.

The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:

1. `onPointerDown`

2. `onPointerMove`

3. `onPointerUp`

4. `onPointerCancel`

5. `onGotPointerCapture`

6. `onLostPointerCapture`

7. `onPointerEnter`

8. `onPointerLeave`

9. `onPointerOver`

10. `onPointerOut`

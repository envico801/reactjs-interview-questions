========== Question ==========  

### How to write comments in React?  

========== Answer ==========  

The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

**Single-line comments:**

```jsx
<div>
    {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
    {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
</div>
```

**Multi-line comments:**

```jsx
<div>
    {/* Multi-line comments for more than
   one line */}
    {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
</div>
```

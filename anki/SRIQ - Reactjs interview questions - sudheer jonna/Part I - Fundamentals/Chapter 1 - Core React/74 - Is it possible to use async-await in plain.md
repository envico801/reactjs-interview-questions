========== Question ==========  

### Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?  

========== Answer ==========  

If you want to use `async`/`await` in React, you will need _Babel_ and [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator) plugin. React Native ships with Babel and a set of transforms.

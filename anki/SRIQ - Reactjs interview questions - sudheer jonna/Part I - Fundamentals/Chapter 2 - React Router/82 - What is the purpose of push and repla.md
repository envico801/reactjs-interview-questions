========== Question ==========  

### What is the purpose of `push()` and `replace()` methods of `history`?  

========== Answer ==========  

A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.

1.  `push()`

2.  `replace()`

If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, `push()` will add a new location to the array and `replace()` will replace the current location in the array with the new one.

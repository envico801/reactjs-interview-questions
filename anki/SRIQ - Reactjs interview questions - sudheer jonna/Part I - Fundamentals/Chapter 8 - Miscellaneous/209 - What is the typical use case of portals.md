========== Question ==========  

### What is the typical use case of portals?  

========== Answer ==========  

React portals are very useful when a parent component has overflow: hidden or has properties that affect the stacking context (e.g. z-index, position, opacity) and you need to visually “break out” of its container.

For example, dialogs, global message notifications, hovercards, and tooltips.

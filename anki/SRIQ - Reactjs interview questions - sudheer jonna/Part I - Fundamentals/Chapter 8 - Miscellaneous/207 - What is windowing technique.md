========== Question ==========  

### What is windowing technique?  

========== Answer ==========  

Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any
given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the
components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application
renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window
and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several
reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data.

========== Question ==========  

### What are the benefits of React Router V4?  

========== Answer ==========  

Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,

1.  In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A
    router can be visualized as a single component(`<BrowserRouter>`) which
    wraps specific child router components(`<Route>`).

2.  You don't need to manually set history. The router module will take care
    history by wrapping routes with `<BrowserRouter>` component.

3.  The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router
    module(Web, core, or native)

========== Question ==========  

### What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?  

========== Answer ==========  

When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior
is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below
rules during reconciliation algorithm,

1.  **Elements Of Different Types:**

    Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the
    old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements `<a>` to
    `<img>`, or from `<Article>` to `<Comment>` of different types lead a full
    rebuild.

2.  **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**

    When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the
    attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the
    changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except
    className attribute,

    ```javascript
    <div className="show" title="ReactJS" />
    <div className="hide" title="ReactJS" />
    ```

3.  **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**

    When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is
    maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying
    component instance to match the new element, and calls
    componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying
    instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm
    recurses on the previous result and the new result.

4.  **Recursing On Children:**

    when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both
    lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever thereâ€™s
    a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the
    children, converting between these two trees works well.

    ```javascript
    <ul>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li>
      <li>third</li>
    </ul>
    ```

5.  **Handling keys:**

    React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key
    to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree.
    For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,

```javascript
<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
```

========== Question ==========  

### Is Hooks cover all use cases for classes?  

========== Answer ==========  

Hooks doesn't cover all use cases of classes but there is a plan to add them soon. Currently there are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate** and **componentDidCatch** lifecycles yet.

========== Question ==========  

### Do you need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?  

========== Answer ==========  

Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with
Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript
build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without
any build process at all.

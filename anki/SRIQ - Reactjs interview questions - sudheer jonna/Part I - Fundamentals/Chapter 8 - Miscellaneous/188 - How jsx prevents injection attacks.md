========== Question ==========  

### How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?  

========== Answer ==========  

React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.

For example, you can embed user input as below,

```javascript
const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
const element = <h1>{name}</h1>;
```

This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application.

========== Question ==========  

### Why are you not required to use inheritance?  

========== Answer ==========  

In React, it is recommended to use composition over inheritance to reuse code
between components. Both Props and composition give you all the flexibility you
need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior explicitly and safely.

Whereas, If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it is
suggested to extract it into a separate JavaScript module. Later components
import it and use that function, object, or class, without extending it.

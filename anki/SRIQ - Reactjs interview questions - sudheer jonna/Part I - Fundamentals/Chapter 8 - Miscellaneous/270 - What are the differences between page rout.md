========== Question ==========  

### What are the differences between page router and app router in nextjs?  

========== Answer ==========  

The Page Router and App Router are two different routing systems in Next.js,
with the App Router being the newer and more feature-rich option. Let's compare
them:

1. Structure:

    - Page Router: Uses a file-system based routing in the `pages` directory.

    - App Router: Uses a new `app` directory with a more flexible file-system
      based routing.

2. Rendering Model:

    - Page Router: Primarily uses client-side rendering with options for
      server-side rendering.

    - App Router: Defaults to server-side rendering with client-side rendering
      as an option.

3. Data Fetching:

    - Page Router: Uses methods like `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and
      `getInitialProps`.

    - App Router: Introduces new data fetching methods within React components,
      supporting both client and server components.

4. Layouts:

    - Page Router: Requires manual implementation of layouts, often using Higher
      Order Components or custom \_app.js files.

    - App Router: Has built-in support for nested layouts using layout.js files.

5. Loading UI:

    - Page Router: Requires manual implementation of loading states.

    - App Router: Provides built-in support for loading UI with loading.js
      files.

6. Error Handling:

    - Page Router: Uses custom error pages (e.g., 404.js, 500.js).

    - App Router: Introduces error.js files for more granular error handling.

7. Static and Dynamic Rendering:

    - Page Router: Configured through separate functions like `getStaticProps`
      and `getServerSideProps`.

    - App Router: Uses a single `fetch` function with caching options to
      determine rendering method.

8. Middleware:

    - Page Router: Middleware applies to all routes.

    - App Router: Allows more granular middleware application, including
      per-route basis.

9. Route Groups:

    - Page Router: Does not have a concept of route groups.

    - App Router: Introduces route groups for better organization without
      affecting the URL structure.

10. Parallel Routes:

    - Page Router: Does not support parallel routes.

    - App Router: Allows rendering multiple pages in the same layout
      simultaneously.

Let's illustrate some of these differences with code examples:

```javascript
// Page Router Example
// pages/index.js
import { useState } from 'react'
export default function Home() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>
}
// App Router Example
// app/page.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <ClientComponent />
    </div>
  )
}
// app/ClientComponent.js
'use client'
import { useState } from 'react'
export default function ClientComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  )
}
// app/about/page.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>
}
// app/layout.js
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
// app/loading.js
export default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>
}
// app/error.js
'use client'
export default function Error({ error, reset }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key observations from these examples:

1. In the Page Router, all components are client-side by default. In the App
   Router, components are server-side by default, and we use the 'use client'
   directive for client-side components.

2. The App Router introduces new files like `layout.js`, `loading.js`, and
   `error.js` for handling common patterns.

3. The file structure in the `app` directory directly corresponds to the URL
   structure, similar to the `pages` directory but with more flexibility.

4. The App Router separates the layout (`layout.js`) from the page content
   (`page.js`), allowing for more reusable and maintainable code.

The App Router is generally recommended for new projects due to its improved
performance and developer experience. However, the Page Router is still
supported and may be preferred for certain use cases or when maintaining
existing projects.

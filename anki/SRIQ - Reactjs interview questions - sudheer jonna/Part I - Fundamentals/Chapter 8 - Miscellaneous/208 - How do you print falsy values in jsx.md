========== Question ==========  

### How do you print falsy values in JSX?  

========== Answer ==========  

The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but
they don't render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to
convert it to string. Let's take an example on how to convert to a string,

```javascript
<div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.</div>
```

========== Id ==========

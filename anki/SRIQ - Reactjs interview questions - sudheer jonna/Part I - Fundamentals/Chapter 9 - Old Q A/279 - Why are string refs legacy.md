========== Question ==========  

### Why are String Refs legacy?  

========== Answer ==========  

If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.

1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.

2. They are _not composable_ â€” if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.

3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.

4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the "render callback" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)

```jsx
class MyComponent extends Component {
    renderRow = (index) => {
        // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:
        return <input ref={'input-' + index} />;
        // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.
        return <input ref={(input) => (this['input-' + index] = input)} />;
    };
    render() {
        return <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />;
    }
}
```

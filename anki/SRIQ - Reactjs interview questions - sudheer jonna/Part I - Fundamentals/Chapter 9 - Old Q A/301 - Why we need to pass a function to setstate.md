========== Question ==========  

### Why we need to pass a function to setState()?  

========== Answer ==========  

The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation.
React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change
immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the
current state when calling `setState()`â€Šsince you can't be sure what that state
will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous
state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting
the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment
operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

```javascript
// assuming this.state.count === 0
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
// this.state.count === 1, not 3
```

If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.

```javascript
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
    count: prevState.count + props.increment,
}));
// this.state.count === 3 as expected
```

**(OR)**

### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for
performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated
asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next
state.

This counter example will fail to update as expected:

```javascript
// Wrong
this.setState({
    counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});
```

The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object.
That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the
props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

```javascript
// Correct
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
    counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
}));
```

========== Question ==========  

### What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes?  

========== Answer ==========  

Flow is a _static analysis tool_ (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time.

PropTypes is a _basic type checker_ (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can't check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component. If you want more flexible typechecking for your entire project Flow/TypeScript are appropriate choices.

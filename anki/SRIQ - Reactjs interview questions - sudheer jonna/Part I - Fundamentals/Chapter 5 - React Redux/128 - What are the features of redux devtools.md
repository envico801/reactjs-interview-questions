========== Answer ==========  

Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,

1.  Lets you inspect every state and action payload.

2.  Lets you go back in time by _cancelling_ actions.

3.  If you change the reducer code, each _staged_ action will be re-evaluated.

4.  If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and
    what the error was.

5.  With `persistState()` store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across
    page reloads.

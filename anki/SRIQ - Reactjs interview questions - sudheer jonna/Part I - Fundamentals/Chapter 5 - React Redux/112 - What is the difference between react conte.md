========== Question ==========  

### What is the difference between React context and React Redux?  

========== Answer ==========  

You can use **Context** in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.

Whereas **Redux** is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API.

========== Question ==========  

### What are the `<Router>` components of React Router v6?  

========== Answer ==========  

React Router v6 provides below 4 `<Router>` components:

1.  `<BrowserRouter>`:Uses the HTML5 history API for standard web apps.

2.  `<HashRouter>`:Uses hash-based routing for static servers.

3.  `<MemoryRouter>`:Uses in-memory routing for testing and non-browser environments.

4.  `<StaticRouter>`:Provides static routing for server-side rendering (SSR).

The above components will create _browser_, _hash_, _memory_ and _static_ history instances. React Router v6 makes the properties and methods of the `history` instance associated with your router available through the context in the `router` object.

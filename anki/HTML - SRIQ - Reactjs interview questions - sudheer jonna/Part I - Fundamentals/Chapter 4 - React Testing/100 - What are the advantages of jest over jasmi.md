========== Question ==========  

### What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?  

========== Answer ==========  

There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

-   Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.

-   Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.

-   Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.

-   Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.

-   Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.

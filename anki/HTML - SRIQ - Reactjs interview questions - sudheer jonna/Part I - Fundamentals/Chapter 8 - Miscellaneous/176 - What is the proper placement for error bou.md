========== Question ==========  

### What is the proper placement for error boundaries?  

========== Answer ==========  

The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches,

1.  You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.

2.  You can also wrap individual components in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application.

========== Answer ==========  

Let's see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.

| React                                                                                       | Angular                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React is a library and has only the View layer                                              | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality                                                                          |
| React handles rendering on the server side                                                  | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side                                       |
| React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing                            | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand                                    |
| React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular's mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower                                                            |
| In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy                            | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

**Note:** The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.

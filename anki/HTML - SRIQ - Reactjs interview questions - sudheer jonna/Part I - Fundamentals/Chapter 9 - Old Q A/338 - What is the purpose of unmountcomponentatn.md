========== Question ==========  

### What is the purpose of unmountComponentAtNode method?  

========== Answer ==========  

This method is available from react-dom package and it removes a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.

The method signature would be as follows,

<!-- codeblock-start -->
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">ReactDOM</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">unmountComponentAtNode</span>(container);
</code></pre>
<!-- codeblock-end -->

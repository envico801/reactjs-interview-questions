========== Question ==========  

### What are the lifecycle methods of React?  

========== Answer ==========  

Before React 16.3

-   **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.

-   **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.

-   **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.

-   **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.

-   **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.

-   **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

-   **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

React 16.3+

-   **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).

-   **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.

-   **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.

-   **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.

-   **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.

-   **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.
